[smashing conference workshop website](https://smashingconf.com/sf-2019/workshops/deque)

## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of the following:

- Git
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Node/npm

Don't worry if you're lacking any of the above, we will walk you through every step of the process so all you have to do is follow along. Feel free to pair up with another attendee!

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
# or npm install
```

## Let's build an accessible modal!

> take a look at index.test.js

[ARIA Authoring Practices - A good place to start](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#dialog_modal)

If you are comfortable writing unit tests you should start by writing out the tests before writing the actual modal functionality (test driven development)

If not, that is perfectly fine. Go ahead and start implementing the modal!

## Run unit tests

```sh
yarn test
# npm test
```

with watcher:

```sh
yarn test --watch
# npm test -- --watch
```

## Start development server

```sh
yarn start
# or npm start
```
