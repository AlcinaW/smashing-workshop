# Smashing 2019 Workshop

> How To Translate Wireframes Into Accessible HTML/CSS

## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of the following:

- Git
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Node/npm
- React (optional)

Don't worry if you're lacking any of the above, we will walk you through every step of the process so all you have to do is follow along. Feel free to pair up with another attendee!

## Getting started

### Cloning the repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dequelabs/smashing-workshop.git
```

There are two branches you can use: `modal-starter-react` and `modal-starter-vanilla`. If you are comfortable writing react or just want to learn basic react, checkout the `modal-starter-react` version. Otherwise, if you'd prefer to just write vanilla js/css/html (or want to set this up with your framework of choice), checkout `modal-starter-vanilla`

### React

```sh
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout origin/modal-starter-react
```

### Vanilla

```sh
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout origin/modal-starter-vanilla
```
